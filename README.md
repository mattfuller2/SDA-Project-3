# Surf vs Ultimate Plan Revenue Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing and comparing the revenue generated by two mobile phone plans: **Surf** and **Ultimate**. The analysis investigates various usage statistics, such as the duration of calls, the number of text messages, and the amount of internet traffic, to determine which plan generates more revenue for the provider.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of customer usage for both plans, **Surf** and **Ultimate**, and determine the plan that contributes more to overall revenue.

### Key Steps in the Project:
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Cleaning missing values.
  - Converting data types where necessary.
  - Checking for and removing duplicates.
  
- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Analyzing the total and average number of calls, messages, and data usage per user for each plan.
  - Calculating monthly revenue based on pricing schemes for both Surf and Ultimate.
  
- **Revenue Comparison**: 
  - Comparing average revenue per user for both plans.
  - Investigating the customer characteristics for each plan that contribute to higher revenues.

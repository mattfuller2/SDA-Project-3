## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and prepared datasets.
   - Merged call, message, and internet usage with user data.
   - Calculated total revenue per user based on their plan and usage.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Counted the number of users on each plan.
   - Visualized usage trends and revenue distributions.
   - Identified any anomalies or outliers.

3. **Revenue Calculation**
   - Computed average monthly revenue for each user.
   - Aggregated results by plan type.

4. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no difference in the average revenue from users on Surf and Ultimate plans.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The average revenue from users on the Ultimate plan is different from those on the Surf plan.
   - Conducted an independent two-sample t-test to assess statistical significance.
